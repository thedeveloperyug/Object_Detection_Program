#Live Object Detection Model

This Machine Learning model uses ssd_mobilenet (it is a single convolution network) to detect the real life objects.

The aim of this project is about to track the specific object in live camera using help of computer vision that helps to track the real word objects, this computer vision module can be used in various applications e.g. we can target the cricket ball during ongoing cricket matches that helps to empire to make the right decisions. Object tracking has a variety of uses, some of which are surveillance and security, traffic monitoring, video communication, robot vision and animation.
